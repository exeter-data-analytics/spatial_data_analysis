1. Check that the following chunk is in index.Rmd
```{r, child = "_setup.Rmd", include = F, purl = F, cache = F}
```

2. Commit all changes and push code to the main repo.

2. Build the book in html using bookdown::gitbook button from 'build book'

3. Add a copy of data.zip and slides.zip into the docs/ folder

4. Add the contents of "docs" folder to your master branch, split it into gh-pages and push to the repo:

git add -f docs
git commit -m "Added docs files to repo"
git subtree split --prefix docs -b gh-pages
git push origin gh-pages --force

This should have deployed your work.

5. Finally, to tifdy up and make sure the repo is not too big, you can remove the gh-pages branch locally, and remove the final commit to master (it's a good idea to check with a git log before removing - you only want to remove the commit that added the "docs" folder, nothing else).

git checkout master
git reset --hard HEAD~1
git branch -D gh-pages
