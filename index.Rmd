# Working with vector data in R


In this module of the workshop we are going to work with vector data (points, lines and polygons). R has an extraordinary potential to handle this data and perform complex spatial operations like other Geographic Information Systems (GIS) software.

Here you will find a link to:
* Data. Download the zip file and store it into a `data/` folder from your Rstudio project.
* Slides.

We will explore the capacities of R to handle and manipulate vector data through two worked examples:

1. Hello, world!

2. Animal oceanographers
